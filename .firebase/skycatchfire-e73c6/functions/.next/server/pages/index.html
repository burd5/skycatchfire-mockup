I like the simple page based routing system. I am excited to try out the new /app directory feature that was released in Next.js 13 to see how the more advanced routing capabilities work. The pre-rendering and image optimization components are great for performance, although I still need to get on some bigger projects to feel the full effect. I am still learning and developing my skills with Next.js, but if I am making a React app, there is a good chance I am using Next.js as well.</p></li><li class="mb-8"><h3>How do you manage state in your apps? Please explain.</h3><p class="text-green-300 text-left text-2xl m-auto mt-5 w-3/4 leading-10">The most common way I manage state is using the useState hook. For example, on the <a class="underline decoration-solid decoration-white underline-offset-4" href="https://github.com/burd5/skycatchfire-mockup/blob/main/src/components/Portfolio.js">Portfolio</a> and <a class="underline decoration-solid decoration-white underline-offset-4" href="https://github.com/burd5/skycatchfire-mockup/blob/main/src/components/TeamMembers.js">Team Member</a> pages, I utilized the useState hook when getting the docs from the firebase database. I also used the useState hook to store the title and post date when adding insights to the database. I often use the url state when I want to add an &quot;active&quot; class to the current nav tab. On my <a class="underline decoration-solid decoration-white underline-offset-4" href="https://github.com/burd5/tea-time">Tea Time</a> app, I am using state to keep track of the form answers. All of these examples could be considered local state because they are managed inside a component. For more complex, global state, context API&#x27;s are a popular choice. Redux has been on my to learn list for a while now so that will be the next thing I add to my &quot;state&quot; toolbelt.</p></li><li class="mb-8"><h3>What&#x27;s your experience with Firebase?</h3><p class="text-green-300 text-2xl text-left m-auto mt-5 w-3/4 leading-10">I have heard of Firebase before but never used it myself. So I took the opportunity to make this app to get a better feel for it. I use MongoDB for almost all of my projects so Firebase&#x27;s NoSQL database felt really comfortable. I set up a couple different collections for the Insights, Portfolio, and Team Members page. I did some basic CRUD requests to practice using the firebase database. I also deployed the website using Firebase&#x27;s built in service. Firebase seems like a useful tool for quickly getting apps into production. There is a heavy focus on analytics and SEO&#x27;s which makes it a good option when creating websites for businesses.</p></li><li class="mb-4"><h3>What&#x27;s your experience with TailwindCSS?</h3><p class="text-green-300 text-2xl text-left m-auto mt-5 w-3/4 leading-10">Tailwind CSS is probably my favorite CSS framework (along with Materialize CSS). I love how intuitive most of the utilities are and it feels more efficient to have everything all in one spot, although some may argue that it violates the &quot;separation of concerns&quot; principle and can crowd a file if a lot of styling is applied. There is a lot of support for Tailwind and I have enjoyed using third party plugins and themes like Daisy UI. I feel really comfortable using Tailwind CSS and it has quickly become the keystone of my styling stack.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"sl_pYF-G-63-f1vVRHMcw","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
