On my ',(0,a.jsx)("a",{className:"underline decoration-solid decoration-white underline-offset-4",href:"https://github.com/burd5/tea-time",children:"Tea Time"}),' app, I am using state to keep track of the form answers. All of these examples could be considered local state because they are managed inside a component. For more complex, global state, context API\'s are a popular choice.
